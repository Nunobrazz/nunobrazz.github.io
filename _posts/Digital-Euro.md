I will start this post by explaining what is a Central Bank Digital Currency. To do so, I will explain what is a Digital Curency.

What is a Digital Currency ?
======

Accorgin to Barata [1] a currency is "any asset that constitutes an immediate form of settling debts, with general acceptability and immediate availability". The same author makes the distinction that money consists of banknotes and coins admitted into circulation. The first definition does not imply currency to be a matererial good. With tha said one can thing about money as the expression of a currency. A currency has the follwing roles in the economy: (1) Medium of Exchange, (2) Unit of account, (3) Store of Value. 


Current solutions to move money
======

Today, people’s money is stored digitally in bank databases. Transfering money between banks is not straightforward, as banks must at least agree on message formats and account identification. To solve this, standardized systems were created to handle payments across banks and countries. For example, SWIFT is used for international transfers, and SEPA is used for payments within Europe. SEPA allows for four euro payment schemes:

  * Credit Transfer (SCT) [Rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2025-09/EPC125-05%202025%20SCT%20Rulebook%20version%201.1.pdf): The originator instructs their bank to transfer an amount of money directly to the beneficiary's bank account.

  * Direct Debit Core (SDD)[Rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2025-10/EPC016-06%202025%20SDD%20Core%20Rulebook%20version%201.1.pdf): Allows creditors to collect payments from debtors' accounts with prior authorization.

  * Business-to-Business [Rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2024-11/EPC222-07%202025%20SDD%20B2B%20Rulebook%20version%201.0.pdf): Allows creditors to collect payments from debtors' accounts with prior authorization, tailored for business-to-business.

  * Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) [Rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2025-10/EPC004-16%202025%20SCT%20Instant%20Rulebook%20v1.1.pdf): Instant credit transfer.

The Instant Property is acheived by using a dedicated real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure. (Explain how they work)
