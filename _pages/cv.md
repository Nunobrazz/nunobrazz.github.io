Education
======
* Ph.D in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon Univerisy, 2024-Present
  * Blockchains represent a unique form of semicommon property, collectively governed through incentives and rules. These rules are programmed in smart contracts, a construct that enabled the appearance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), introducing novel types of organizations and governance models. This work aims to study these organizations operating in a decentralized and permissionless environments, where a majority of agents are rational. We apply mechanism design frameworks to the governance challenges in DAOs.
* M.S. in  Computer Science and Engineering, Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon Univerisy, 2022-2024
  * Took the Cyber-security and Algorithms specializations as well as some courses from the math master’s related to Cryptography, Machine Learning, and Theory of Computation, with grades including 18 in Cryptography and Security Protocols, 17 in Software Security, 17 in Introduction to Learning Theory, 16 in Computability and Complexity, and 18 in Advanced Algorithms. The final average grade was 16/20
* Hands-on Learning for Emerging Technologies in Electronics Engineering, at Beijing Institute of Technology, July 2024
  * Learned about new electrotechnical concepts and tools and introduced myself to the Chinese culture and history.
* Exchange Program at Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires, 2023
  * Engaged in a multicultural environment and completed courses on artificial intelligence in Spanish.
* B.S. in Information Systems and Computer Engineering, at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon Univerisy, 2019-2022
  * Covered plenty of different fields in computer science including several programming languages with a highly practical approach with grades including 18 in Distributed Systems, 18 in Logic for Programming, 18 in Machine Learning, 16 in Complex Analysis and Differential Equation and, 17 in Probabilistic and Statistics. The final average grade was 16/20.
