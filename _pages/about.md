I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, with a broad range of research interests spanning computer science, mathematics, and economics. My doctoral research focuses on incentive mechanisms for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). I am particularly interested in the intersection of governance incentive mechanisms and decentralized finance. Additionally, I have a strong curiosity in the theory of computation and various areas of mathematics. Additionally, I am teaching assistant for the courses Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.
