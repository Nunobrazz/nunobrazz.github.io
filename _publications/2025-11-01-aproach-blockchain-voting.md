We explore a blockchain-based voting protocol tailored for low-electorate, weighted-voting environments. The blockchain ensures correctness and censorship-resistance. The cryptographic primitives, namely Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE) and signatures of knowledge to ensure correctness, privacy, and weak coercion-resistance under the assumption that a minimum number of voters are honest.
