<!--
As a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** for the *Distributed Systems* undergraduate course at **Instituto Superior Técnico**, I supported students in understanding key concepts of distributed computing, including consistency models, fault tolerance, and consensus protocols.

Responsibilities
======
- Assisted in preparing and grading programming assignments focused on **message passing**, **replication**, and **synchronization**.  
- Conducted **weekly lab sessions** to guide students through the implementation of distributed algorithms in **Java**.  
- Helped design **practical exercises** simulating real-world distributed environments.  
- Provided **one-on-one tutoring** and **office hours** to clarify theoretical and implementation challenges.  
- Collaborated with the teaching staff to evaluate project deliverables and provide constructive feedback.  

Skills and Tools
======
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Java, gRPC, REST  
- **Concepts:** Consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft), Replication, Fault tolerance, Event ordering  
- **Environment:** UNIX systems, Docker, Git  

Reflection
======

This experience deepened my understanding of the challenges in designing reliable and scalable distributed systems and strengthened my ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly to others.
